Here are some of the commands that need to be done to push the temporary data into the db:-

npx prisma generate

npx prisma db push

npx prisma studio

For SQL db i have used the aiven console.

For Postgres i have used neon console. 

U can visit this sites and create a new project from there and copy the database url and copy paste it into the .env file, and you are all set to use the db.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
